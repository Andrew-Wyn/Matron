## description

e-mail spam identifier, written in python, based on tensorflow v1 

## usage

you need to download *docker* and *docker-compose*  to run efficiently this example without download all necessaries dependencies (requirements.txt is located under ./core/app)

i have implemented only the make script for unix environments, to run you have to type:

```bash
make (to bring up the container) 
```
 
and after:

```bash
make app (to run the main script)
```
 
or:

```bash
make shell (to attach a shell to the app service)  
```
